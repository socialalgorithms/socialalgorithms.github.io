title: "Yale S&DS: Social Algorithms"
---
<!--
## NOTE: Sylalbus in progress -- will be removed when syllabus is finalized.
-->


## Course Description

Algorithms that learn from data play increasingly central roles within modern complex social systems. In this course, we examine the design and behavior of algorithms in such contexts, including search, content recommendation, social recommendation, feed ranking, content moderation, and more. The course has a split focus on the technical design of such algorithms, as well as the literature on theoretical and empirical evaluations, particularly in the presence of strategic behavior, network effects, and algorithmic confounding.

## Course structure and evaluation
The class is organized around two lectures per week. Generally speaking, the first lecture of each week will on the technology, with the second lecture of the week being focused on impacts and evaluations. Lectures are designs to be discussion-driven, espcially when we debate conclusions from the impacts and evalutations literature.

There are three problem sets and a project. See the weekly schedule below for a timeline. There are no quizzes, midterms, or exams. All submissions are due on Canvas by the start of lecture on the described days. Attendance is expected but not strictly mandatory. Please contact me if you expect to miss more than an occasional lecture.

Homework assignments are to be done in groups of 2-3, and the final project in groups of 2-5. You are strongly encouraged to form interdisciplinary teams for both the homework and project. All group members should be involved in completing each part of the homework assignments (i.e., think pair programming as opposed to divide-and-conquer). Projects are fine to divide-and-conquer.

There is an ungraded “Problem Set 0” for self-evaluation, available on the course homepage. It is intended to make sure you feel comfortable coding at the level that will be assumed as prerequisite. It is very strongly encouraged (if only to clean up the coding environment on your machine). No submissions of PS0 will be accepted.

Completing the assignments will require setting up accounts and using APIs that aren't always free, or where paid versions are far superior to free versions. I constantly keep an eye out for free alternatives, but also want you to train with the best tools of today. Therefore I ask students be prepared to spend approximately $30-50 as part of this class. If this would be a hardship then please reach out to me. There are no required textbooks or other course materials. 

## Grading and late policies
* 45% Problem Sets (15% each)
* 10% Project proposal
* 40% Project presentation and report
* 5% Participation and collegiality

Problem sets and project proposal: your best bet is to hit all the deadlines. Failing that, the following policy is designed to prioritize completing problem sets over not completing them, submitting problem sets over not submitting them.  
- One single delay of up to 2 days (48 hours), no questions asked. 
- After that: 5 points deducted per day (per 24h, including weekends), up to 6 days. Limited CA availability. 
- After that: no CA support will be provided and max grade is a 70. Must be submitted by 11:59p on the final day of semester (after that, grade is 0), and no guarantees on grading turn-around time.

Project: No extensions on the project. If you need an extension, please contact me to discuss my policy for taking an incomplete for the course.

In the event of a family or medical emergency, I am fundamentally a reasonable person. Please contact me as soon as possible.

## Academic integriry 

Academic integrity is a core institutional value at Yale. It means, among other things, truth in presentation, diligence and precision in citing works and ideas we have used, and acknowledging our collaborations with others. 

Collaboration in this course is strongly encouraged, but all collaboration must be acknowledged. Failure to disclose collaboration (including allowing someone else to represent your work as their own) will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will be reported to Yale College for arbitration.

## AI Policy

I encourage you to use and sharpen your use of AI tools as part of this course. The problem sets are complex and can not be solved top-to-bottom by any currently avaialble AI tools. For each problem set and for the project, I will ask you to document how you used AI, what was useful and what wasn't, so we can all learn together about best practices. Mindless use of AI (i.e., submitting work that is nonsensical or wrong in ways where you can't explain what you did) will be graded harshly. Undocumented use of AI will be considered a violation of academic integrity.

## Honor code violations
In the event that a student is found to have violated the honor code, the penalty may include a full denial of credit for the course (not just the assignment). See the Student Conduct Penalty Code, Section J.
-->

## Accommodations:
If you need accommodations for the class, please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS). If you have an accommodation for the class (e.g., extra examtime, or have any other documented disability), please send me an email to let me know. Please also include the letter from SAS so that I can make arrangements accordingly.

## Computing Environment

A Unix-like setup is strongly recommended (e.g., Linux, OS X, or Cygwin). We will use Python 3 (JupyterLab is recommended).
